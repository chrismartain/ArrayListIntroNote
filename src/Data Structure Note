Data Structure

* Data Structures are ways to store Data in a computer Program.
* Different data Structures exist because some are faster than others
or more suitable for some particular tasks

 An Example is a DataStructure like the following

 - Elements get appended at the end of the structure
 - Elements get removed from the beginning of the structure
 - How is this DataStructure called ?
   Since we are talking about Object oriented programming a sequence like
   the one described above can be called a QUEUE
 - Just think of people in a Queue: First-in, first-out

   [2][4][6][8][10][12]
   [1][3][5][7][9][11]

   The most common data Structures are:

   _ Queue
   - Stack
   - Set
   - Binary tree

    INTRODUCTION TO LINKED LIST

    - A linked list is a sequence of items which are not fully independent
    - Each item in this sequence knows where the next items is (hence the Linked part)
      means each items in the list has a pointer and it's point to the location in our
      computer's memory where the following item in the list is stored. This makes going
      from one item to the next very quickly without having to look in memory and search
      for it

  Example:

        - Let imagine we are creating a  Linked List of Students
        - Each element (Node) holds the name, matriculation number, and year of study
          for each student.:

          Node
        String name                                                                                      NULL
       String matric_number             NB: "George"                                                      ^
        int year_study                     "1575465G"                                                     |
          Node next                         "2"                                                           |
                                           Node next ---------->> : "Anna"                                |
                                                                 "3324515P"                               |
      The Class node has the same dataType as the                    3                                    |
      variable next                                                Node next -------->> : "Philip"        |
                                                                                          "7785657L"      |
                                                                                              3           |
                                                                                            Node Next-----|
       As we can see in the Illustration above the nodes in the sequence have
       common attribute, and they all contain the variable next which point to the
       location of the following corresponding item in the computer's memory and the
       sequence end when it reaches the item or element Null. meaning there's no more
       items or element in the list/ or sequence. And the process stops.


        IMPLEMENTING THE LINKED LIST

        - NB: we need to create two classes: The node class and the list Class
            - Node (holds the data and the next node)
            - List (Manages the nodes, and holds the first node): Because if each node
            points to the next node then there is node that point to the first one

            This means that:
                    The List class has methods to:
                    - Find a node in the List, for which we need to supply the student name
                    - Add a new node at the beginning of the List

    List are by an Essential part of java and must be studied thoroughly to understood properly
     or you might endup making serious mistakes in your career of software developement. We continue with more explanation
     nextweek.
